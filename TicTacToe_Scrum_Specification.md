# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Specification (Python Django Version)

## Overview
Develop a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid via a web interface. The application will be built using Python and Django.

---

## User Stories

### 1. As a player, I want to start a new game, so that I can play Tic-Tac-Toe with another player.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A “New Game” button is available on the web interface.
  - The board resets when a new game starts.
  - A new Game object is created in the Django backend.

---

### 2. As a player, I want to take turns placing my symbol (X or O) on the board, so that I can play my move.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The board alternates between X and O after each turn.
  - A cell cannot be selected if it is already occupied.
  - Moves are persisted in the Django database and reflected on all clients (pages refresh or via AJAX).

---

### 3. As a player, I want to be notified when someone wins or when the game is a draw, so that I know the outcome.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - A message appears when a player wins, highlighting the winning combination.
  - A message appears when the game ends in a draw.
  - Game status is stored in the Django backend.

---

### 4. As a player, I want to view the current game state, so that I always know whose turn it is.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The interface displays whose turn it is (X or O).
  - The current turn is tracked by the backend and exposed in the game state API.

---

### 5. As a player, I want to play again after a game is finished, so that I can have a rematch.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - After a win or draw, the “New Game” button is enabled to reset the board and scores (if tracking).
  - Rematches create a new Game object or reset the current one.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- The game should work on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- The user interface should be responsive for desktop and mobile.
- The game should not allow cheating (e.g., playing out of turn or overwriting a cell).
- Django backend must validate all moves and game logic.

---

## Technical Notes

- **Tech Stack:** Python 3.x, Django (latest stable version), Django templates or Django REST Framework (if API-based), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactivity).
- **Models:** At minimum, a `Game` model (tracks board state, players, turn, status) and a `Move` model (optional, for move history).
- **Views:** Django views or API endpoints for creating games, making moves, fetching game state.
- **Front End:** Django templates or a simple JS/HTML front end to interact with the backend.
- **Persistence:** All game data (board state, moves, player info) stored in Django's database.
- **Deployment:** Local development using `manage.py runserver`; instructions for running and testing included in the repository.

---

## Optional Enhancements (Backlog)

- Track and display player scores across multiple games.
- Add single-player mode against a basic AI (can be implemented server-side in Django).
- Allow players to enter their names.
- Add simple animations for moves and win/draw notification.
- Enable real-time updates using Django Channels (websockets).

---

## Out of Scope

- Online multiplayer over the internet (real-time with accounts)
- User authentication

---

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria above are met.
- Code reviewed and merged to main branch.
- Game is deployed to test/staging environment.
- No critical bugs remain.
- README includes setup and usage instructions for Django app.
