I'm a product manager for a software company and i want to create a specification for use in scrum for a tic-tac-toe game.
Copilot said: Absolutely! Creating a specification for a Tic-Tac-Toe
Absolutely! Creating a specification for a Tic-Tac-Toe game to be used in a Scrum environment involves clearly defining the product requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and possibly some technical and design considerations. Here’s a simple, structured example specification you can use as a starting point and adapt for your team’s backlog.


TicTacToe_Scrum_Specification.md
v1
# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Specification

## Overview
Develop a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid via a web interface.

Let me know if you want to break this down into individual Jira issues, add wireframes, or tailor it for a particular tech stack!

It looks like I'm unable to access your repository jimmyhaacker/tictactoe-django at the moment. Please double-check that the repository exists and is public, or that I have permission to access it.

Once access is available, I can immediately proceed to create all the drafted issues in your new repository. If you have just created the repository, it sometimes takes a few moments for permissions and visibility to update—please try again shortly, or let me know if you need to adjust any repository settings for access.

Copilot said: Great! Here’s what you need to do
Great! Here’s what you need to do to ensure I (GitHub Copilot) can access your repository:

If your repository is private:
Make sure you are interacting with me (Copilot) in a context where you are logged in with the same account that owns or has access to the repository (jimmyhaacker).
You may need to add GitHub Apps or integrations if required for Copilot to access private repositories, but for most chat operations, being the repository owner and using chat here is sufficient.
If your repository is public:
Double-check that the repository is set to public.
Confirm the correct repository URL/slug: jimmyhaacker/tictactoe-django (no typos).
General checklist:
The repository exists and is not empty.
You have at least one commit (repositories with no commits may not be recognized).
You are interacting with Copilot in a browser session where you are authenticated as the owner/user with access.
After making these adjustments, let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll proceed to create the issues in your repository! If you encounter a specific error, please let me know what it says for further help.

        ('O', 'Player O'),
    )
    STATUS_CHOICES = (
        ('IN_PROGRESS', 'In Progress'),

        ('O_WON', 'O Won'),
        ('DRAW', 'Draw'),
    )
    player_x_name = models.CharField(max_length=30, default="Player X")
    player_o_name = models.CharField(max_length=30, default="Player O")
    current_turn = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=PLAYER_CHOICES, default='X')

class Move(models.Model):
    game = models.ForeignKey(Game, related_name='moves', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    player = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=Game.PLAYER_CHOICES)
    position = models.IntegerField()  # 0-8 for 3x3 grid
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

+---------------------------+
```

---

## Notes

- Board state can be stored as a 9-character string (e.g., "XOX O XO ") for simplicity.
- All validation and win/draw checking should be done server-side.
- Use AJAX or page reloads for move submissions (no real-time websockets required for MVP).
- Wireframes are text-based for clarity; UI can be styled as desired.

Thank you for your feedback! To clarify, I do not directly create real GitHub issues unless you specifically ask me to do so, and unless I have the necessary repository context and permissions.

If you ever see file blocks (like name=filename.md), those are drafts or templates meant to help you preview or refine issue content before posting them as real GitHub issues. When you want me to actually create real issues on GitHub, just let me know the repository and I’ll create them directly as real issues—no file drafts necessary.

If you’d like me to create real GitHub issues now, just provide the repository name (e.g., owner/repo), and I’ll take care of it! If you have more feedback or want a different workflow, let me know how I can help.
