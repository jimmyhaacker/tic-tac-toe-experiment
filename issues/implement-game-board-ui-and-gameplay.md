# Implement Game Board UI and Gameplay

Implement the game board interface allowing two players to play.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 3x3 grid is displayed.
- Players can click cells to make moves alternately.
- Board updates after each move.
- Invalid moves (cell already occupied, playing out of turn) are prevented.

**Wireframe:**
```
+---------------------------+
|   Player X (X) vs Player O (O)   |
|   Current Turn: X                |
|                                 |
|     |     |     |
|  X  |  O  |     |
|-----|-----|-----|
|     |  X  |     |
|-----|-----|-----|
|  O  |     |  X  |
|                                 |
|  [ Play Again ]                 |
|                                 |
|  [ Message: X wins! ]           |
